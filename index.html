        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I am a 19 year old guy born and raised in Puerto Rico. Going to college in Chicago, IL.
        </p>
        <p>
            My major is in Information Technology and Mangement with plans 
            of getting my masters degree in Cyber Forensics and Security.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first opportunity I had to turn monetize a hobby of mine came on my freshman year at Chicago, where 
            a good friend of mine referred me to a security company and I got the job as event security for concert venues and 
            NFL games.
        </p>
        <p>
            My next objective is to turn my passion in the field of Applied Technology into a career were I have the 
            opportunity to contribute creative solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my free time I stay up to date with the latest trends and I continue to learn new skills that are 
            essential to my personal and professional goals.
        </p>

            Further in my career I will build my own commercial platforms and companies that introduce creative solutions.
        </p>
